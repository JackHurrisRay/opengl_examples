# OpenGL examples
This is a list of examples done a few years ago after a computer graphic course to better understand opengl and apply some of the effects existing.

Content of the repo:

- Triangle: hello world program, tests the display and the buffers
- Rotating cube: Add movement in the scene and transormation matrices
- Texture plane: Tests textures, both from an image and generated
- Sphere light: Different lightings on a sphere: Flat Goureaud and Phong with interacitvity to select the lighting type

## How to build
Create a `build` folder in the example you want to build, then from the `build` folder, `cmake ..` to populate it and `make` to build the example
